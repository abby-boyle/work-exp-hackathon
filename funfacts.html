        <h2>Fun Facts about the Rover Curiousity</h2>
        <p>
            Curiosity is about 3 metres (10 feet) long and weighs about 900 kg (2,000 pounds), which makes it the longest 
            and heaviest rover on Mars. (By contrast, the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, are 1.6 metres 
            [5.2 feet] long and weigh 174 kg [384 pounds].) Unlike previous rovers, Curiosity did not have its landing cushioned 
            by air bags; rather, because of its large size, it was lowered to the surface by three tethers from the spacecraft’s body, 
            called the sky crane. <br />

            The landing sequence was highly intricate. After a parachute significantly slowed the vehicle and after its heat 
            shield—which had protected the rover during its entry into the atmosphere—was discarded, the spacecraft was eased 
            toward the planet’s surface by rockets that stabilized the vehicle, allowing it to hover and protecting it from horizontal winds. 
            Curiosity had also shed its protective shell on the way to the planet’s surface, and its mobility system—wheels and suspension—had 
            already been released while still in the air. Curiosity was therefore ready to rove immediately after it landed, unlike the Mars Exploration 
            Rovers, which had to wait for their lander “petals” that enclosed the rovers to open. Once touchdown of Curiosity had occurred, 
            onboard computers released the tethers. The sky crane then pitched away and crashed far from Curiosity.
